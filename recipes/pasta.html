    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Pasta is a type of food made from a mixture of flour, eggs, and water<br>
         that is formed into different shapes and then boiled.<br>
         Spaghetti, macaroni, and noodles are types of pasta.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
        <li>A large (6- to 8-quart) pot</li>
        <li>Four to six quarts of cold water></li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
        <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>
        <li>A colander for draining the pasta</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta,<br>
             add salt to the boiling water. If you don't season the cooking water,<br>
              the pasta may taste flat — no matter how salty the sauce may be.<br>
               The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta,<br>
             so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Stir gently. Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it to water,<br>
             but let spaghetti and long strands soften for a minute before stirring.<br>
             Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite.<br>
             The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets.<br>
              Don't rely on the clock to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead.<br>
               If it's done, it will be firm but tender and cooked through.<br>
                If you're using cooked pasta as an ingredient in a recipe<br>
                 — like baked ziti or lasagna — it can be even firmer,<br>
             as the noodles will absorb liquid and cook more in the oven.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Drain the pasta in a colander.<br>
             Do not rinse the pasta with water unless your recipe specifically says to.<br>
              For example, if you're making a cold pasta salad,<br>
               you would rinse the hot pasta with cool water to stop the cooking.<br>
                Lasagna is another example of a pasta noodle that can be rinsed after cooking.<br>
                Otherwise, return the drained pasta to the pot and cover to keep it warm,<br>
                 or toss it with sauce. Here's where the reserved pasta water comes in handy to help thicken or thin the sauce,<br>
                 depending on the recipe you use.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Serve pasta immediately. We highly recommend using warm bowls!

    </ol><br>
